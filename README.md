# Sports Ticket Calculation System 🎫

A robust C++ application designed as a term project for **Computer Programming II**. This system automates the management and financial processing of sports club ticket data using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

##  Features
- **Data Input:** Accepts manual input for club names and reads ticket prices from external `.txt` files.
- **Financial Calculations:** - Calculates the **Total Price** and **Average Price** of all tickets.
  - Applies a **20% price increase** across all clubs.
  - Identifies the **Lowest Price** and applies a specific **30% markup**.
- **Data Sorting:** Implements the **Bubble Sort** algorithm to organize ticket prices.
- **Automated Reporting:** Generates and exports detailed reports into multiple categorized text files (e.g., `Total Price.txt`, `Average Prices.txt`).

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **C++ Programming:** Core logic and syntax.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Effective use of Classes, Constructors, and Destructors.
- **File Handling (I/O):** Reading from `ifstream` and writing to `ofstream`.
- **Algorithms:** Implementation of sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort).
- **Data Structures:** Handling and manipulating Arrays.
- **Formatting:** Using `<iomanip>` for structured console and file output.
